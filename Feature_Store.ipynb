This is because we need to provide the model data with the same characteristics as the data it was trained on. If we don’t do that, we will get a difference between training and serving, and the model predictions will not be as good.\n",
        "* Many companies will use the same features across a variety of models and so it is a central hub for those features to be used by many models. Feature stores make sure there is no repetitive engineering setup as well as different pre-processing steps for the same features\n",

If the clients requesting predictions will not know the feature values, then we need a mechanism to inject the feature values into incoming prediction requests. The feature store plays that role. For example, one of the features of a dynamic pricing model may be the number of web site visitors to the item listing over the past hour. The client (think of a mobile app) requesting the price of a hotel will not know this feature’s value. This information has to be computed on the server using a streaming pipeline on clickstream data and inserted into the feature store. You can also imagine that if you have to fetch a alot of data, this cannot be done quick enough.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The second situation is to prevent unnecessary copies of the data. For example, consider that you have a feature that is computationally expensive and is used in multiple ML models. Rather than using a transform function and storing the transformed feature in multiple ML training datasets, it is much more efficient and maintainable to store it in a centralized repository.\n",
